# Anime Regex for Sonarr

## Dual-Audio Regex

Having tested most of these settings, they work pretty well but Anime is a fickle beast to toy with so be warned.

## Anime Delete

If you have issues with extra files being download like NCED or NCOP then check [here](Anime_Delete.md)

## Media Management

There a few settings which make life a lot easier when tracking down and keeping certain information for your Anime. A lot of this is from [TRaSH](https://trash-guides.info/) with tweaks to make it work better with HamaAgent for plex.
| Name | Input | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Anime Episode Format | `{Series TitleYear} - S{season:00}E{episode:00} - {absolute:000} - {Episode CleanTitle} [{Preferred Words }{Quality Full}]{[MediaInfo VideoDynamicRange]}[{MediaInfo VideoBitDepth}bit]{[MediaInfo VideoCodec]}{[Mediainfo AudioCodec}{ Mediainfo AudioChannels]}{[MediaInfo AudioLanguages]}{-Release Group}` | Has all necessary information and a little extra if you needed to rebuild. |
| Series Folder Format | `{Series TitleTheYear} [tvdb-{TvdbId}]` | ~~We do not want year here as it messes with the HamaAgent and how it identifies the anime. [Reference](https://forums.plex.tv/t/rel-http-anidb-metadata-agent-hama/40470/2043?u=visoseph)~~ I'm a dummy. Adding year back in with tvdb id allows matching to be correct. Thanks salty.  |
| Season Folder Format | `Season {season:00}` | Standard format that best covers most uses. |
| Multi-Episode Style | `Scene     S01E01-E02-E03` |

## Quality Profile

We need to set add HDTV-1080p into the same group as WEB-DL and WEBRip 1080p so that it will download correctly and not upgrade past HDTV-1080P if Preferred Words does not allow it.

### First Release Profile

| Term | Score | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `/\b(uncensored)\b/i`                                                         | 1000 or -1000 | This is for if you want the uncensored version of anime. If you would like it to be priority then set to 1000. If you do not want uncensored set it to -1000.|
| `/(dual[ ._-]?audio)/i`                                                  | 500 | Dual-Audio profile |
| `/(multi[ ._-]?audio)/i`                                                | 400 | Multi-Audio profile |

### Include Preferred when Renaming

We set this so when renames or new media is added it's easily identifiable as dual/multi audio.

### Must Not Contain List (Added in with the second release profile)

The reason most of these are added is due to their shitty quality or just in general are not as good as other stuff that is out there. This can be tweaked as needed. Let me know if you run into any issues here. You should be able to just copy paste these in.

```bash
/(CuaP|EMBER|PnPSubs|ICEBLUE|URANiME|SLAX|Golumpa|KaiDubs)/i,
/\b(Beatrice|ohys|Kawaiika|neko|LowPower)\b(?=[ ._-]?(raws)\b)/i,
/(?=(english|funi)).*(dub|dubbed)|\b(dub|dubbed)\b/i
```

We do not set preferred words here as it can cause issues with long filenames.
